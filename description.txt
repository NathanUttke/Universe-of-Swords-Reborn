Universe of Swords Mod Reborn is a port of the Universe of Swords Mod from tModLoader 1.3, and adds tons of melee class weapons, which mainly consist of swords.
The original mod creator, Gnom, abandoned the mod, so I created an unofficial 1.4 port of it. Credit for all the original mod code and sprites goes to the original creators.
